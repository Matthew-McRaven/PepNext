/*
 * This class assigns a unique identifier to each data path. Embedding that identifier in a trace packet allows us to
 * reconstruct the entire dataflow without tracing all intermediate devices.
 *
 * In a system, a transaction may cross multiple device to reach its destination. For example, the SimpleBus transforms
 * an address in the bus space to an address in a child device's space. Recovering that path (e.g., finding the
 * initiator and address it accessed) is generally impossible without auxillary data. Consider the following topology:
 * // clang-format off
 * SimpleBus A   SimpleBus B
 *         \        /
 *          Device D
 * // clang-format on
 * Since A & B's address translation remains constant during simulation, we ought to avoid tracing them.
 * If tracing only D and given a trace packet one cannot determine the initiator nor the address that was sent to the
 * bus. On a real bus, the device would have an address in the bus space and would perform any address translation on
 * the internal side of the bus interface, but the above logic still stands.
 *
 * This issue is relevant to minimizing the set of addresses we update in the memory dump pane after a simulation step.
 * Only devices like RAM or MM IO ports are traced, and traces are addressed relative to the interal address space of
 * the traced device. We must reconstruct the path the transaction took from the CPU to the device to identify the
 * correct address to re-render.
