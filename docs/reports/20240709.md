  - Building Qt from sources with the right flags
  - Online IDE built into github for linux for colab editing
- Single-step, run-to-finish debugging steps
- Automated deployment pipeline from push
  - Deploy WASM bundle on each commit to main

# Discussion
- Creating a working Qt 6 build environment, updated README instructions to include required additional libraries.

# Bugs / improvements
Give editor focus on switch to on
"Help" in multiple spots, rename. No parity between mode and menus, names conflict
Remove coloring from input & output
Increase height on CPU pane (too small on Mac OS)
After running program, should stop debugging at ISA level
Memory dump pane colors are too saturated
ISA didn't highlight first line of object code
Switching level of abstraction screws up help
"Figure Figure" in help label on figure view
Move Mac OS menus to the top (see https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qml-qt-labs-platform-menubar.html)
Need 3 options in main area: "Create ISA3 project in bare metal mode", "Create OS4 project", "Create assembly project in bare metal mode", "Create ASMB5 project with full OS"
        MC2 with 1 Byte bus
        MC2 with 2 Byte Bus
        ISA3, bare metal
        assembly language, bare metal
        OS4
        ASMB5, with OS
        RISCV ISA3, bare metal
Use verbs for menu items, and nouns for mode stuff
        EDIT/DEBUG=>CPU for MC2
        EDIT=>Object Code for ISA3
        EDIT=>ASSEMBLER for ASMB5
        DEBUG=>DEBUGGER
        HELP=>Reference
Move FORMAT and INSERT to EDIT verb
Add STATISTICS noun
Take application screenshots in pipeline for help system.
HELP verb/menu gets merged into HELP noun/mode
