Add a virtual table pointer, which points to an array of methods.
	These methods will be used in place of things like "CWA", allowing for NT and XT magic to work
	See GForth manual about these words

Change header organization
	Put string name at the start, followed by flag/len column.
	Then, put link pointer, followed by all other fixed length fields.
	Lastly, follow with data/code body.
	The link pointer will still point to the link pointer of the previous entry, except now name will be at a "negative" offset from the link pointer
	This organization allows you to get to the body of the code from the link pointer with no additional memory accesses.
	(Idea taken from GForth implementation)
