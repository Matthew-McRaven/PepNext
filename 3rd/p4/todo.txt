Add a virtual table pointer, which points to an array of methods.
	These methods will be used in place of things like "CWA", allowing for NT and XT magic to work
	See GForth manual about these words

Add nested dictionaries
    More than one dictionary may be in main memory at any given time
    A single task should be able to use more than one of these dictionaries
    This would give the ability for having multiple non-interfering tasks
    The dictionaries will probably be interleaved in main memory since I do not have a virtual memory mechanism

Add recovery task
    If the user program panics, we should be able to halt VM execution, and step into an interactive debug task
    This task would have a "debugger" vocabulary loaded
    The debug vocab should have the ability to execute statements inside of the problematic task

Add an interactive terminal program
    This would make it easier to play with a demo

Add ability to remove dictionary entries
